function mask_patch(p,sdir,xlow,xhigh,ylow,yhigh,zlow,zhigh)

% Internal matlab routine for Clawpack graphics.

% Get stored Cartesian coordinates.  If we are not plotting a manifold or
% mapped grid, we probably don't need to store this, but we do it anyway
% so that we don't have always check for the manifold or mapped grid
% condition.

udata = get(p,'UserData');

% Use tolerance s so we don't mask cells that are just beyond masked patch.
% this value depends on the precision of dx,dy,dz stored in the fort.qXXXX
% files. If they are stored in single precision, than setting the
% following to 1e-8 will leave gaps in the masking.  So assuming single
% precision is probably a good idea here.
