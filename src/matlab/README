Insructions on using the Matlab graphics for visualizing Clawpack/PyClaw
output :

   -- First, make sure that $CLAW/visclaw/src/matlab is in your Matlab
      path.  You can do this either by setting the environment variable
      MATLABPATH, or by using the Matlab ADDPATH command.

   -- To get started with the plotting, you can type

           >> plotclaw2
      or
           >> plotclaw3

      at the Matlab prompt to plot output in fort.XXXX files produced by Clawpack
      or PyClaw.  Other file formats (HDF) are supported to a limited extent.  See
      READAMRDATA for ideas on how to support your own file format.

   -- The ClawGraphics routines will run files setplot2.m or setplot3.m to initialize
      graphics parameters.  To customize properties like axis limits, camera view angles,
      colormaps, gridlines, patchborders, etc.  you can supply an 'afterframe.m' file
      which gets run after each frame has been plotted.  Both the setplot<n>.m files and
      afterframe file can be customized for particular examples, and should be located in
      your working directory.
